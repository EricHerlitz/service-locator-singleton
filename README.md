# service-locator-singleton
I needed something simple but highly customizable and testable with the ability to initialize and bind class instances using annotations. I got inpsired by the way EPiServer constructed their ServiceLocator and how easy it is to register the types with class annotations. I wrapped it and used Microsoft Unity for the IoC.
